## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.

There was a significant difference in percentage of 5 star reviews between paid and non-paid members since percentage for paid reviews was more than 50% whereas non-paid reviews hit less than 40%. Thus, paid members are more crucial in terms of 5 star reviews. Since vine is pretty restricted, I believe analyzing more dataset for other products would be helpful for comparison purposes to determine whether there was a biases between paid and nonpaid members.
